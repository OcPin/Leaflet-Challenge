# Leaflet-Challenge


For this task, I developed a seismic activity representation by retrieving information from a geojson API. I generated markers on the map to denote earthquakes, adjusting the size of each marker to mirror the earthquake's magnitude. The color of each marker was indicative of the earthquake's depth. Moreover, I incorporated tooltips for each data point, providing crucial information such as magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake.
